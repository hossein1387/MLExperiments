## Linear Regression

Implementation of a simple linear regression. First we generate some random data (by default the code will generate a nosiy -3x + 2):

    n = -3*m + 2 + 2*np.random.rand(len(m))

The rest of the code will try to fit the best line while keeping the cost low. You can play with *learning_rate* and *thr* to see the how it will effect the consumed time. Here is a sample output:
